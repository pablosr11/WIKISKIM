## Download wikipedia articles for offline reading

## TODO:

- show progress count during download
- build + download epub instead of zip
- check other languages
- detect redirects and re-request. i.e routing algorithm redirects to routing. we would need to keep links clean
- include images?
- what to do wrt "dangerous" articles?
