### how to create an epub with pure html?
###


To create an EPUB file with pure HTML, you can follow these general steps:

Organize your HTML files: If you have multiple HTML files, ensure they are properly structured and linked together. If you're starting from scratch, write the content in HTML format.

Create the necessary EPUB structure files: An EPUB file is essentially a ZIP file containing several files and folders. You'll need to create a few essential files, such as the mimetype file, META-INF/container.xml file, and the content.opf file, which contains metadata and a manifest of all the files in the EPUB. You can find more details on how to create these files in thoughtco.com.

Add CSS styles: Create CSS files for styling your content, such as page_styles.css and text_styles.css. Include them in your HTML files using the <link> element, as you would with any web page.

Zip the files: Once you have all the necessary files and folders, compress them into a ZIP file. Make sure the mimetype file is the first file in the ZIP archive and is not compressed. Rename the ZIP file to have an .epub extension.

Alternatively, you can use tools and libraries to simplify the process. Some options include:

Pandoc: This command-line tool can convert your HTML files directly into an EPUB file. You can find more information on using Pandoc in ebooks.stackexchange.com.

Calibre: Calibre is an ebook management and conversion tool that can convert HTML files into various ebook formats, including EPUB. You can use the ebook-convert utility that comes with Calibre to perform the conversion, as mentioned in ebooks.stackexchange.com.

Each approach has its pros and cons. Creating an EPUB file from scratch gives you full control over the structure and formatting but requires more manual work. On the other hand, using tools like Pandoc or Calibre can simplify the process but may not provide the exact output you desire, especially if you have specific formatting requirements.

### Can you give an example of how to properly structure and link HTML files for an EPUB?
###

To properly structure and link HTML files for an EPUB, you should organize your content into a hierarchical directory structure. Here's an example of a simple structure:

/my-ebook
  /html
    /chapter1
      chapter1.html
    /chapter2
      chapter2.html
  /images
  /styles
  /scripts
  content.opf
  toc.ncx
In this example, the my-ebook folder contains separate folders for HTML content (html), images (images), styles (styles), and scripts (scripts). Each chapter has its own folder and HTML file.

To link between chapters, you can use relative file paths. For example, to link from chapter1.html to chapter2.html, you would use the following code within chapter1.html:

<a href="../chapter2/chapter2.html">Next Chapter</a>
To include images, styles, and scripts in your HTML files, you can also use relative file paths. For example, if you have an image called example-image.jpg in the images folder and you want to include it in chapter1.html, you would use the following code:

<img src="../../images/example-image.jpg" alt="Example Image" />
Similarly, to include a CSS file called styles.css from the styles folder, you would use the following code in the <head> section of your HTML file:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="../../styles/styles.css" />
And to include a JavaScript file called script.js from the scripts folder, you would use the following code in the <head> or <body> section of your HTML file:

<script src="../../scripts/script.js"></script>
By organizing your files in a clear and structured manner, you can easily maintain and update your EPUB content as needed.

### Imagine we want chapter 1 to link to chapter two inside. How do we accomplish this?
###

To link from Chapter 1 to Chapter 2 within the EPUB, you can use the standard <a> tag with an href attribute containing the relative path to the target chapter. In this example, you would add the following code within chapter1.html:

<a href="../chapter2/chapter2.html">Go to Chapter 2</a>
This code creates a hyperlink that, when clicked, navigates to chapter2.html. The text "Go to Chapter 2" serves as the link text that the reader can click on.

If you want to link to a specific section within Chapter 2, you can use an anchor tag with an id attribute in chapter2.html:

<h2 id="section2-1">Section 2.1</h2>
Then, in chapter1.html, you can link to this section using the following code:

<a href="../chapter2/chapter2.html#section2-1">Go to Section 2.1 in Chapter 2</a>
This creates a hyperlink that navigates directly to the section with the id "section2-1" in chapter2.html.

### What are the contents of toc.ncx and content.opf?
###

The `toc.ncx` (Navigation Control file for XML) and `content.opf` (Open Packaging Format) are essential files in an EPUB file structure. Here's a brief overview of their contents:

**toc.ncx**

The `toc.ncx` file contains the e-book's table of contents. It defines the navigation points for the e-book, allowing readers to jump between sections or chapters. In EPUB 2, the table of contents is constructed using nested `<navPoint>` elements to create a hierarchical list of navigation points. Here's an example of a simple `toc.ncx` file:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE ncx PUBLIC "-//NISO//DTD ncx 2005-1//EN"
  "http://www.daisy.org/z3986/2005/ncx-2005-1.dtd">
<ncx xmlns="http://www.daisy.org/z3986/2005/ncx/" version="2005-1">
  <head>
    <meta name="dtb:uid" content="urn:uuid:12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012"/>
    <meta name="dtb:depth" content="1"/>
    <meta name="dtb:totalPageCount" content="0"/>
    <meta name="dtb:maxPageNumber" content="0"/>
  </head>
  <docTitle>
    <text>My Ebook Title</text>
  </docTitle>
  <navMap>
    <navPoint id="chapter1" playOrder="1">
      <navLabel>
        <text>Chapter 1</text>
      </navLabel>
      <content src="html/chapter1/chapter1.html"/>
    </navPoint>
    <navPoint id="chapter2" playOrder="2">
      <navLabel>
        <text>Chapter 2</text>
      </navLabel>
      <content src="html/chapter2/chapter2.html"/>
    </navPoint>
  </navMap>
</ncx>
```

**content.opf**

The `content.opf` file is an XML file that contains the structural data of the EPUB. It includes metadata, a manifest of all the assets in the publication, the default reading order of the chapters, and a guide pointing to the cover, table of contents, and the beginning of the e-book's text.

Here's an example of a simple `content.opf` file:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<package xmlns="http://www.idpf.org/2007/opf" version="2.0" unique-identifier="BookID">
  <metadata xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" xmlns:opf="http://www.idpf.org/2007/opf">
    <dc:title>My Ebook Title</dc:title>
    <dc:creator>Author Name</dc:creator>
    <dc:identifier id="BookID">urn:uuid:12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012</dc:identifier>
    <dc:language>en</dc:language>
  </metadata>
  <manifest>
    <item id="chapter1" href="html/chapter1/chapter1.html" media-type="application/xhtml+xml"/>
    <item id="chapter2" href="html/chapter2/chapter2.html" media-type="application/xhtml+xml"/>
    <item id="ncx" href="toc.ncx" media-type="application/x-dtbncx+xml"/>
  </manifest>
  <spine toc="ncx">
    <itemref idref="chapter1"/>
    <itemref idref="chapter2"/>
  </spine>
</package>
```

The `metadata` section contains information about the e-book, such as title, author, language, and unique identifier. The `manifest` lists all the assets, including HTML chapters, images, fonts, CSS files, and scripts. The `spine` defines the default reading order of the chapters, and the `guide` (deprecated in EPUB 3) points to the cover, table of contents, and the beginning of the e-book's text.
